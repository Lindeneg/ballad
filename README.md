# Ballad

Loneliness and an unhealthy relationship to social media is pervasive in our society, especially amongst young adults.

In a nutshell, Ballad would be an application attempting to connect people together for physical meetups relative to their geographical location.

Matching should be done via a recommendation engine that takes multiple metrics into account. For example, a match between interests/hobbies could be a predictor for how well two (or more) people connect.

Loneliness is a huge problem in our society and I don't think social media - or apps of similar nature - does anything to remedy this.. rather to the contrary.

Get away from the screen, go outside with friends. But to find those friends, or expand your friend group, an application like Ballad could potentially be very useful.
